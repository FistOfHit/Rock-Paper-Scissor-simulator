# Rock-Paper-Scissor-simulator

A 2D entity-based Rock-Paper-Scissor simulator done entirely by vibe-coding. Using Gemini 2.5 and Manus.

## Introduction

In this game, rocks, papers, and scissors move around the canvas following realistic physics-inspired behaviors. Entities chase, flee, and even convert each other based on the traditional rules of Rock-Paper-Scissor. With both global and type-specific settings, you have control over the simulation’s parameters to create unique gameplay experiences!

## Features
